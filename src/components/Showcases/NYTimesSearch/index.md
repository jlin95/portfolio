I wanted to try out New York Times' APIs, so I decided to make a simple search-based UI for users to type in an author's name, and return a list of book reviews.
Written with Hooks API! Deployed to Netlify. This was inspired by [this Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/here-are-some-app-ideas-you-can-build-to-level-up-your-coding-skills-39618291f672).
