I graduated from the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) and went to join
the engineering team at [Ninja Van](www.ninjavn.co) where I work on developing the company's external-facing web applications, working in a cross-functional team of product designers, product managers, QA engineers, and fellow developers.
